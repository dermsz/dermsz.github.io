	<h1>Experience</h1>
	<div id="div1">
	<p class="webtextexperience">I have 7 years’ experience in the IT field starting with an apprenticeship at the old age of 24.<br><br>

		Since then, my knowledge and experience has grown from end user single desktop support to multinational support for thousands of users working as a member of an MSP support team. I have supported network infrastructure from SOHO’s to MPLS circuits. <br><br>
		
		I always try to develop myself and learn as much as I can. I am currently trying my hand at development starting with front end, to back end with the goal of broadening my knowledge to cover a full stack environment. <br><br>

	<h1>Experience</h1>
	<div id="div1">
	<p class="webtextexperience">I have 10 years’ experience in the IT field starting as an enthusiast/hobbyist from the age of 12.
		My professional career started at the age of 24 with an apprenticeship, I set up AOL when i was a child and thought I knew everything. I was completely wrong.<br><br>

		Since then, my knowledge and experience has grown from end user single desktop support to multinational support for thousands of users working as a member of an MSP support team. 
		I have supported network infrastructure from SOHO’s to MPLS circuits. I have completed multiple microsoft and Comptia certifications. I am also a professional member of the BCS<br><br>
		I always try to develop myself and learn as much as I can. 
		I am currently trying my hand at development starting with front end, to back end with the goal of broadening my knowledge to cover a full stack environment. <br><br>
